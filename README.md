## 👋 About This Project

I'm currently learning Java and this is one of my first projects — and **my very first attempt at building a user interface thats not a console** using Swing.  
It's a simple **task manager** that lets you:

- ✅ Add tasks
- ✅ Mark them as completed (with checkboxes)
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ View task descriptions (double-click) - Seems to not work right now
- ✅ Set due dates using a calendar picker

This was made as a learning experience, so the code isnt so great
especially the UI stuff

## 📦 How to Run It

In the file, enter the executable file and run the `MakesEverythingWork.cmd` file

> ⚠️ **Important**:  
> Please run the app using the `MakesEverythingWork.cmd` file. It’s **totally safe** and just runs the Java `.jar` file.

I understand if its fishy for you since i have one public repo with one project but theres 3 lines in the file and its posted on in here, look through it as hard as you want, its just 3 lines

```cmd
@echo off
java -jar Task_Manager.jar
pause
